# Ad Sentiment & ROI Predictor

**Predict how well your ad will perform â€” before you post it.**

This project combines **machine learning**, **sentiment analysis**, and **digital marketing insight** to forecast the potential performance of online advertisements based on ad copy, platform, budget, and posting time. Designed for marketers, startups, and small business owners, it helps optimize campaigns before they go live.

---

## Problem Statement

Digital marketers often rely on guesswork or past experience to decide how an ad will perform. What if a machine learning model could **predict the effectiveness of an ad** based on key features â€” such as the wording, platform, timing, and budget â€” before any money is spent?

This project addresses that challenge by predicting **CTR (click-through rate)** or **engagement level** using a trained ML model informed by real or simulated ad campaign data.

---

## Objectives

- Predict ad performance (CTR or ROI category) before launch  
- Analyze ad text using **NLP sentiment tools**  
- Provide **feature importance** explanations (e.g., SHAP)  
- Deploy a simple app (optional) using **AWS SageMaker** or **Google Vertex AI**
